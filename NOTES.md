# NOTES.md — MoleBridge, source of truth

Read this first, every session. `README.md` is for someone using the repository;
this is for someone changing it.

## Thesis

Existing free stoichiometry tools either solve the problem or explain the
procedure. None attribute a specific wrong number to a specific conceptual
failure and report that to the teacher. **Attribution is the product.** Every
design decision below follows from that, and the one thing this must never
become is a solver.

The audience is one classroom: a high school chemistry teacher, students on
managed Chromebooks, a ViewBoard at the front of the room, and Canvas. Static
site, no backend, no accounts, no cookies, offline after first load, and no
student PII ever — identity is a teacher-assigned roster number from 1 to 4095.

## Where this stands

**Session 1 is complete.** The domain engine, the completion-code codec and the
test suite are built and green: 107 tests, a clean strict type check with no
`any` in the tree, and no runtime dependencies at all. There is no user
interface, on purpose.

The two numbers session 1 existed to produce:

- **Taxonomy collisions: 0**, over 10,000 generated problems and 135,564
  predicted wrong values.
- **E-UNCLASSIFIED rate: 10.32%** over 34,422 deliberately wrong entries. About
  a quarter of the sweep's entries are a factor of ten out and are unclassified
  by definition, so that is close to the floor for this sweep rather than a
  gap in the taxonomy.

Both are printed by `npm test` and by `node tools/cli.ts scan`.

## Settled decisions, and the reasoning that is easy to lose

### Where the specification contradicted itself, and what was implemented

**The completion code is 120 bits, not 115.** §8.2 heads the payload "115 bits"
and then sums its own field list to 119, padded to 120 for exactly 24 Base32
characters. 119 is the correct sum for the fields listed and 120 is the only
total that gives 24 characters, so the implementation is one leading pad bit
plus 119 bits of fields and MAC. The "115" is an arithmetic slip in a headline,
contradicted three lines later by the specification itself.

**The MAC covers the leading 96 bits, which is exactly the first twelve bytes.**
§8.3 says "the 96-bit payload prefix", and the fields before the MAC are 95
bits. The pad bit plus those 95 bits is 96, byte-aligned, so both statements are
satisfied at once and nothing had to be invented.

**The A4 remediation fires above half an order of magnitude, not one.** §7 asks
for A4 on "E-ARITH with |log10 error| >= 1", but §6.2 has already reclassified
anything that far out as E-UNCLASSIFIED — taken literally the branch is dead
code. A4 is the magnitude-checking remediation, so it fires on an arithmetic
slip bigger than about a factor of three and stops where E-UNCLASSIFIED begins.
The threshold is `SCINOT_TRIGGER_LOG10` in `src/engine/tolerance.ts` with the
reasoning beside it.

### The decomposition fix §6.2 demanded

**E-LIM-WRONG and E-LIM-BYMASS were one observable, and the stages were split
rather than a tiebreak added.** With exactly two reactants there is one wrong
box to tick at the comparison stage, so both classes predicted the same entry.
§6.2 forbids a tiebreak heuristic and says to fix the decomposition, so:

- **S4c**, the choice of limiting reactant, reports a wrong choice as
  **E-LIM-BYMASS** — comparing the two stated masses is the overwhelming reason
  a student picks wrong there, and §7 routes that class to the proportion
  remediation, which is the one that helps.
- **S5**, the mole yield carried forward, reports **E-LIM-WRONG** when the
  student chose correctly at S4c and then entered the other reactant's yield.
  That is a distinct, common and separately observable event.

### Generation guarantees added because a collision sweep found something

Each of these exists because a scan over generated problems found two classes
predicting the same value. In every case the fix was to refuse to pose the
problem, never to add a heuristic to the classifier.

- **`MOLAR_MASSES_SEPARABLE`.** Where the given and the wanted substance weigh
  nearly the same per mole, substituting one molar mass for the other moves the
  answer less than rounding does. E-CONV-FACTOR and E-ROUND-EARLY became one
  observable at S6, and E-RATIO-MASS and E-RATIO-UNBALANCED became one at S4.
  Two collisions in the first 200 problems; both were this shape.
- **`LIMITING_MARGIN_MET`** gained a second condition. The chemistry condition
  is that two reactants within a hair of each other make the comparison a coin
  toss. The taxonomy condition is that the other reactant's yield has to be a
  different number at the precision the student writes, or E-LIM-WRONG cannot
  be told from having rounded early.
- **`YIELD_SEPARABLE`.** A yield near 100% makes the upside-down fraction land
  on the right answer: 100/y and y meet at y = 100.

After these, 10,000 problems produce zero collisions.

### Other judgement calls

**Molar mass reports two precision answers, and neither is guessed.** A molar
mass is a sum, so the arithmetic rule that governs it is addition's — the
coarsest decimal place among the contributing weights. §5.3 asks instead for the
fewest significant figures among the contributing elements. For water those give
18.015 and 18.02. `MolarMass` carries both, names the element that set each, and
leaves the marking decision to the E-SIG-FIGS class rather than picking one
silently.

**Significant figures are graded only at the last stage.** Rounding an
intermediate is E-ROUND-EARLY, an error in its own right, so a stage machine
that demanded a rounded intermediate would be marking students down for the
thing it elsewhere calls a mistake.

**Element weights are never padded to five figures.** §5.1 asks for at least
five significant figures and says never to round in the data file. Those two
pull against each other: IUPAC publishes hydrogen's conventional weight as
1.008, four figures, on purpose, because the isotopic composition varies between
natural sources and a fifth digit would claim the sample is known. The file
carries what is published, and `sigFigs` records how many figures that is.
Writing 1.00800 to tidy a column would be inventing a measurement.

**Two problem kinds in the specification's spirit were not built.**
Mass-to-moles and moles-to-mass would make stage S6 an identity conversion,
which is a stage that cannot fail and therefore cannot teach anything. The four
kinds built — mass to mass, mass to particles, mass to volume at STP, limiting
reagent, percent yield — all keep every one of the six gated stages real.

**Node strips the TypeScript, so the tree has no runtime dependencies and no
build step.** `tsc` is the only entry in `devDependencies`, present to type
check rather than to compile. That is the strongest supply-chain position
available and it matches the no-third-party-runtime-dependencies constraint
exactly rather than approximately.

**SHA-256 is implemented in the repository.** WebCrypto's digest is
asynchronous, which would make the codec asynchronous, which would make the step
machine asynchronous. `node:crypto` does not exist in a browser. A package is
ruled out by the same constraint. The tests cross-check the implementation
against `node:crypto` over random input, which is the one thing it cannot do for
itself.

### Two defects the tests found, worth remembering

**`formatSigFigs` measured the magnitude before rounding.** 9.96 at two figures
came out as `10.0`, which reads as three. It surfaced through a taxonomy fixture
that fed a predicted wrong value back in and got E-UNCLASSIFIED, because the
entry written at four figures had silently become five. The fix is to round
first and measure the rounded value.

**The particle-count problems were being silently rejected.** A physical-bounds
guarantee applied a classroom-balance range to every stage value, and
1.4e24 particles is the correct answer rather than an absurd one. Tier 2 looked
healthy and had quietly lost a whole problem kind. The test that catches it now
asserts that every problem kind actually appears in a sweep.

## What sessions 2 and 3 owe

**Session 2 — the user interface.** The rules the engine is built to support and
that a screen must not break:

- The correct answer is **never** displayed before the student's attempt at that
  stage. `solve()` and `predictionsFor()` are the grader's; a screen renders a
  `Problem`, which deliberately carries no coefficients, no molar masses and no
  intermediates.
- `solveBalance` must not be reachable from any student-facing path. `balance.ts`
  names the one export that is safe there — `checkBalance`, which grades a
  coefficient set the student has already committed to and cannot be run
  backwards.
- Remediation is injected at the failing stage, never offered as a menu.
- A completion code is 24 characters and the student will retype it. Show it
  grouped 5-5-5-5-4, selectable, and large enough to read off a Chromebook
  screen at arm's length.
- Everything the doctrine's §7e asks of every app: an information control in the
  app's own chrome, first-run orientation that survives whatever is pressed to
  begin, patch notes from one source, a text diagnostic, and a way to say the
  app has gone stale. Plus the on-screen build stamp from the first deploy
  (§7b).

**Session 3 — the teacher decoder and the print view.** The decoder takes a
pasted gradebook column, decodes each code, and reports a per-student and
class-wide error histogram. `decodeCompletionCode` already returns everything it
needs, including the four verdicts and the named consistency failures. Note that
it reports fields for a code that verifies but contradicts itself, and reports
nothing at all for a code whose MAC failed — the teacher-facing wording has to
keep those apart.

## Repository obligations still open

- **Branches.** This repository has `main` and the harness branch. The family
  convention is `staging` and `main`, with `staging` a hard release gate — that
  matters from the first deploy, which has not happened, and needs setting up
  before session 2 ships anything.
- **`.branch-guard` and the generated pre-commit hook** are not installed yet.
  They should be, in the same change that creates `staging`.
- **`ACCESSIBILITY.md`** is owed as soon as there is any UI, and a new surface
  must join the accessibility gate's surface list in the same commit that
  creates it, or it ships unmeasured.
- **Repo metadata** — description, website, topics, social preview — is a manual
  GitHub step. Proposed values are in the hub's `METADATA.md`; nothing is set
  until they are applied there.
